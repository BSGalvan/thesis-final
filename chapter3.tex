\chapter{Population Analysis}\label{ch:analysis}

    Using the population models described in Chapter \ref{ch:synthesis}, one can derive
    the properties of NSBH mergers as seen in the GW as well as EM regimes.
    Specifically, an important aspect of NSBH mergers is what fraction of mergers
    actually produce a prompt component which will be detectable by present-day
    Gamma-ray detectors, such as INTEGRAL. A related aspect is the dependence of this
    fraction on the priors which go into creating these populations. Specifically,
    different black hole spin prior distributions should affect the number of detectable
    prompt emissions, and so this behaviour is worth investigating.\\
    Furthermore, this population synthesis framework also helps to investigate the
    rate density of NSBH mergers which lead to observalble SGRBs, which can then be
    compared to the number derived currently from purely EM observations.
